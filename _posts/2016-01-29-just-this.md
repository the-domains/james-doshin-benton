Just This...
![](https://the-grid-user-content.s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/833799ee-f247-4e6b-b0a8-c054a23ddc98.png)

When we are able to just observe anything that enters into our experience, we can rest assured that we will discover something new about it. The light of awareness clears the way for a deeper understanding of that which it has been directed towards.

So, our job here is to always just look a bit closer without painting our experience with opinion, belief or expectation of any kind. Everything then can arrive as "Just This" within our field of perception, and a deeper understanding is always sure to follow.

Thank you for joining me here...
